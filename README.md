great what you can do in an hour.

=what it does=

first, the IR sensor detects if a person is there, 
for the sake of simplicity.. it waits 2 seconds, 
if someone is there it begins to start the motors.
if after 10 seconds somone is still stupid enough to be there (8 seconds later)
it will fire a ball at their face!
during this time if somone moves away.. it will shutdown and got into sleep mode,
also after firing one ball it will go into sleep mode 
if somone disrupts the beam, the process starts again (wakeup)


=note to self=
# i need to pay for
- 2 3cell battery packs (i'm keeping one)
- 1 4 cell battery pack (ehh.. arduino needs that 5v :/
